Cymbalta is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor
antidepressant (SSNRI). Duloxetine affects chemicals in the brain that may be
unbalanced in people with depression.

Cymbalta is used to treat major depressive disorder in adults. It is also used
to treat general anxiety disorder in adults and children who are at least 7
years old.

Cymbalta is also used in adults to treat nerve pain caused by diabetes
(diabetic neuropathy), or chronic muscle or joint pain (such as low back pain
and osteoarthritis pain).

Cymbalta is also used to treat fibromyalgia (a chronic pain disorder) in
adults and children at least 13 years old.
