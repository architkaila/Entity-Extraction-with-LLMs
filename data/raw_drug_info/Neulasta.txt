Neulasta is a man-made form of a protein that stimulates the growth of white
blood cells in your body. White blood cells help your body fight against
infection.

Neulasta is a prescription medicine used to prevent neutropenia (a lack of
certain white blood cells) that is caused by receiving chemotherapy.

Neulasta helps reduce the chance of infections.
