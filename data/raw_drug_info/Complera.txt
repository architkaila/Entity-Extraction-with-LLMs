Complera contains a combination of emtricitabine, rilpivirine, and tenofovir.
Emtricitabine, rilpivirine, and tenofovir are antiviral medicines that prevent
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from multiplying in your body. HIV causes
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

Complera is used to treat HIV in people who have never taken HIV medicines
before. This medicine is for use in adults and children who are at least 12
years old.

Complera is not a cure for HIV or AIDS.

Complera should not be taken together with other antiviral medications to
treat HIV or AIDS.
