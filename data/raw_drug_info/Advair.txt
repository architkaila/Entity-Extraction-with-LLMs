Advair contains a combination of fluticasone and salmeterol. Fluticasone is a
steroid that prevents the release of substances in the body that cause
inflammation. Salmeterol is a bronchodilator. It works by relaxing muscles in
the airways to improve breathing.

Advair inhalation is a combination medicine used to prevent asthma attacks. It
is also used to prevent flare-ups or worsening of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) associated with chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema.

Advair Diskus is for use in adults and children who are at least 4 years old.
Advair HFA is for use in adults and children who are at least 12 years old.
