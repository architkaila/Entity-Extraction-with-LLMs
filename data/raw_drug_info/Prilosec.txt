Prilosec is a proton pump inhibitor that decreases the amount of acid produced
in the stomach.

Prilosec is used to treat symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
and other conditions caused by excess stomach acid. Omeprazole is also used to
promote healing of erosive esophagitis (damage to your esophagus caused by
stomach acid).

Prilosec may also be given together with antibiotics to treat gastric ulcer
caused by infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori).

Over-the-counter Prilosec OTC is used in adults to help control heartburn that
occurs 2 or more days per week. Prilosec OTC must be taken as a course for 14
days in a row.
