Symbicort contains a combination of budesonide and formoterol. Budesonide is a
corticosteroid that reduces inflammation in the body. Formoterol is a long-
acting bronchodilator that relaxes muscles in the airways to improve
breathing.

Symbicort is used to control and prevent the symptoms of asthma in adults and
children at least 6 years old.

Symbicort is also used to help control the symptoms of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.

Symbicort is not for use in treating an asthma or bronchospasm attack.

For people with asthma: Symbicort is for use only if asthma is severe or is
not well-controlled on other long-term asthma medicines. Your doctor may tell
you to stop using this medicine once your asthma is well-controlled.

Formoterol when used alone may increase the risk of death in people with
asthma. However, this risk is not increased when budesonide and formoterol are
used together as a combination product.
