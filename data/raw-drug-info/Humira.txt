Humira is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker that reduces the effects of a
substance in the body that can cause inflammation.

Humira is used to treat many inflammatory conditions in adults, such as
rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque
psoriasis, and a skin condition called hidradenitis suppurativa.

Humira is also used in adults and children to treat Crohn's disease, juvenile
idiopathic arthritis, ulcerative colitis and uveitis.
