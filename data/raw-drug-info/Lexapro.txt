Lexapro (escitalopram) is an antidepressant from the group of drugs called
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and is used to treat certain
types of depression and anxiety. It is not known how Lexapro works, but it is
thought to block the reuptake of serotonin by nerves. This results in an
increase in serotonin concentrations in the nerve synapse (the space between
two nerves).
