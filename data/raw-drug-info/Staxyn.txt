Staxyn belogs to a class of medications called phosphodiesterase (PDE)
inhibitors. Vardenafil relaxes muscles found in the walls of blood vessels and
increases blood flow to particular areas of the body.

Staxyn orally disintegrating tablets work by increasing blood flow to the
penis during sexual stimulation. This increased blood flow can cause an
erection.

Staxyn orally disintegrating tablets are used to treat erectile dysfunction
(impotence; inability to get or keep an erection) in men.

Staxyn does not cure erectile dysfunction or increase sexual desire. This
medicine does not prevent pregnancy or the spread of sexually transmitted
diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
