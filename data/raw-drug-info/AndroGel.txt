AndroGel contains testosterone, a naturally occurring male hormone necessary
for many processes in the body. It works by replacing or supplementing the
testosterone that is naturally made in the body.

AndroGel is used to treat conditions in men that result from a lack of natural
testosterone.

AndroGel will not enhance athletic performance and should not be used for this
purpose.

periods, or any other signs of male characteristics.
