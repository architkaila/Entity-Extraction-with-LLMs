Prezista is a protease (PRO-tee-ayz) inhibitor antiviral medicine that
prevents human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from multiplying in your body.

Prezista is used to treat HIV, the virus that can cause acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

Prezista must be given in combination with ritonavir and other antiviral
medications and should not be used alone.

Prezista is not a cure for HIV or AIDS.

Prezista** (hives, difficult breathing, swelling in your face or throat) **or
a severe skin reaction** (fever, sore throat, burning eyes, skin pain, red or
purple skin rash with blistering and peeling).
