Zocor belongs to a group of drugs called HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, or
"statins."

Zocor is used to lower blood levels of "bad" cholesterol (low-density
lipoprotein, or LDL), to increase levels of "good" cholesterol (high-density
lipoprotein, or HDL), and to lower triglycerides (a type of fat in the blood).

Zocor is also used to lower the risk of stroke, heart attack, and other heart
complications in people with diabetes, coronary heart disease, or other risk
factors.

Zocor is used in adults and children who are at least 10 years old.
