Amlodipine besylate belongs to a class of medications called calcium channel
blockers. It lowers blood pressure by relaxing the blood vessels so the heart
does not have to pump as hard.

Amlodipine is used to treat certain types of angina (chest pain) and other
conditions caused by coronary artery disease (narrowing of the blood vessels
that supply blood to the heart).

Amlodipine besylate controls chest pain by increasing the supply of blood to
the heart. If taken regularly, this medicine controls chest pain, but it does
not stop chest pain once it starts. Your doctor may prescribe a different
medication to take when you have chest pain.

Amlodipine is also used alone or in combination with other medicines to treat
high blood pressure (hypertension) in adults and children at least 6 years
old. Lowering blood pressure may lower your risk of a stroke or heart attack.

pressure, pain spreading to your jaw or shoulder, nausea, sweating.
