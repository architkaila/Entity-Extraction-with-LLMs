Viagra relaxes muscles found in the walls of blood vessels and increases blood
flow to particular areas of the body.

Viagra is used to treat erectile dysfunction (impotence) in men. Another brand
of sildenafil is Revatio, which is used to treat pulmonary arterial
hypertension and improve exercise capacity in men and women. This page
contains specific information for Viagra, not Revatio.

Do not take Viagra while also taking Revatio, unless your doctor tells you to.
