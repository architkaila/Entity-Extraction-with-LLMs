Protonix is a proton pump inhibitor that decreases the amount of acid produced
in the stomach.

Protonix is used to treat erosive esophagitis (damage to the esophagus from
stomach acid caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD) in adults and
children who are at least 5 years old. Pantoprazole is usually given for up to
8 weeks at a time while your esophagus heals.

Protonix is also used to treat Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and other conditions
involving excess stomach acid.





Get emergency medical help if you have **signs of an allergic reaction to
Protonix:** hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue,
or throat.

Call your doctor at once if you have:

  * severe stomach pain, diarrhea that is watery or bloody;

  * sudden pain or trouble moving your hip, wrist, or back;

  * bruising or swelling where intravenous pantoprazole was injected;

  * **kidney problems** \- fever, rash, nausea, loss of appetite, joint pain, urinating less than usual, blood in your urine, weight gain;

  * **low magnesium** \- dizziness, fast or irregular heart rate, tremors (shaking) or jerking muscle movements, feeling jittery, muscle cramps, muscle spasms in your hands and feet, cough or choking feeling; or

  * **new or worsening symptoms of lupus** \- joint pain, and a skin rash on your cheeks or arms that worsens in sunlight.

Taking pantoprazole long-term may cause you to develop stomach growths called
fundic gland polyps. Talk with your doctor about this risk.

If you use pantoprazole for longer than 3 years, you could develop a vitamin
B-12 deficiency. Talk to your doctor about how to manage this condition if you
develop it.

Common Protonix side effects may include:

  * headache, dizziness;

  * stomach pain, gas, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea;

  * joint pain; or

  * fever, rash, or cold symptoms (most common in children).

This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur. Call your
