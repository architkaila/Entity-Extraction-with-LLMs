Nexium is a proton pump inhibitor that decreases the amount of acid produced
in the stomach.

Nexium is used to treat symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and
other conditions involving excessive stomach acid such as Zollinger-Ellison
syndrome. It is also used to promote healing of erosive esophagitis (damage to
your esophagus caused by stomach acid).

Nexium may also be given to prevent gastric ulcer caused by infection with
Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), or by the use of nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Nexium is not for immediate relief of heartburn symptoms.

throat.

Taking esomeprazole long-term may cause you to develop stomach growths called
fundic gland polyps. Talk with your doctor about this risk.

B-12 deficiency. Talk to your doctor about how to manage this condition if you
develop it.
