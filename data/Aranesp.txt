Aranesp is a man-made form of a protein that helps your body produce red blood
cells. This protein may be reduced when you have kidney failure or use certain
medications. When fewer red blood cells are produced, you can develop a
condition called anemia.

Aranesp is used to treat anemia caused by chemotherapy or chronic kidney
disease.

Aranesp** (hives, wheezing, difficult breathing, severe dizziness or fainting,
swelling in your face or throat) **or a severe skin reaction** (fever, sore
throat, burning in your eyes, skin pain, red or purple skin rash that spreads
and causes blistering and peeling).
