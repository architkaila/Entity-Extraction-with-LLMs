Infliximab is a type of biological therapy called a monoclonal antibody that
may be used to treat certain autoimmune conditions characterized by
inflammation such as:

  * Rheumatoid arthritis in adults which is also being treated with methotrexate
  * Ankylosing spondylitis in adults
  * Psoriatic arthritis in adults
  * Chronic, severe, plaque psoriasis in adults when other treatments are less appropriate
  * Crohn's disease in adults and children 6 years of age and older that has not improved with other medications or adults with fistulizing disease
  * Ulcerative colitis in adults and children 6 years of age or older that has not improved with other medications.

Instead of having generics, infliximab has biosimilars. Biosimilars are near-
identical copies of the first brand of infliximab (Remicade) and just as safe
and effective with similar dosing regimens. Although there are no clinically
meaningful differences, they are usually significantly less expensive. There
are four FDA-approved biosimilars of infliximab but only three are available
on the U.S. market:

  * infliximab-axxq (Avsola)
  * infliximab-dyyb (Inflectra)
  * infliximab-abda (Renflexis).
