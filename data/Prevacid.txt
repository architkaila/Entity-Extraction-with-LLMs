Prevacid is a proton pump inhibitor. Lansoprazole decreases the amount of acid
produced in the stomach.

Prevacid is used to treat and prevent stomach and intestinal ulcers, erosive
esophagitis (damage to the esophagus from stomach acid), and other conditions
involving excessive stomach acid such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.

Prevacid OTC (over-the-counter) is used to treat frequent heartburn that
happens 2 or more days per week.

Prevacid is not for immediate relief of heartburn symptoms.
