Levitra (vardenafil) belongs to a class of medications called
phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors. Vardenafil relaxes muscles found in the
walls of blood vessels and increases blood flow to particular areas of the
body.

Levitra works by increasing blood flow to the penis during sexual stimulation.
This increased blood flow can cause an erection.

Levitra is used to treat erectile dysfunction (impotence; inability to get or
keep an erection) in men.

Levitra does not cure erectile dysfunction or increase sexual desire. This
medicine does not prevent pregnancy or the spread of sexually transmitted
diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
