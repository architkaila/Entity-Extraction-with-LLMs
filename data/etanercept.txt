Etanercept (Enbrel) is a TNF blocker used to treat plaque psoriasis,
rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or
polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in specific patients. Etanercept
works by decreasing tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a protein produced by the
immune system to help the body fight infections. In people with autoimmune
disorders, the immune system produces too much TNF and mistakenly attacks
healthy cells.

Etanercept is FDA-approved to treat specific types of:

  * plaque psoriasis in patients 4 years and older
  * rheumatoid arthritis
  * psoriatic arthritis
  * ankylosing spondylitis
  * polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in patients 2 years or older.

Etanercept became an FDA-approved medicine on November 2, 1998.
