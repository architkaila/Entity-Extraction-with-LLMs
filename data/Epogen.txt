Epogen is a man-made form of a protein that helps your body produce red blood
cells. This protein may be reduced when you have kidney failure or use certain
medications. When fewer red blood cells are produced, you can develop a
condition called anemia.

Epogen is used to treat anemia caused by chemotherapy or chronic kidney
disease, anemia caused by taking zidovudine to treat HIV (human
immunodeficiency virus), or anemia due to other reasons.

Epogen is also used to reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions in
people having certain types of surgery.

Epogen** (hives, sweating, rapid pulse, wheezing, trouble breathing, severe
