Rituxan is a cancer medicine that interferes with the growth and spread of
cancer cells in the body. It is also used to treat other non-cancer
conditions.

Rituxan is an intravenous (IV) infusion given by a healthcare professional. It
is a prescription medicine used alone or in combination with other medicines
to treat the following conditions:

  * non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia in adults;

  * rheumatoid arthritis in adults;

  * granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis (rare disorders that cause inflammation of blood vessels and other tissues in the body) in adults and children 2 years of age and older; or

  * pemphigus vulgaris (a severe autoimmune reaction that causes blisters and breakdown of the skin and mucous membranes) in adults.





Get emergency medical help if you have **signs of an allergic reaction to
Rituxan:** (hives, difficult breathing, swelling in your face or throat) **or
a severe skin reaction** (fever, sore throat, burning eyes, skin pain, red or
purple skin rash with blistering and peeling).

Some side effects may occur during the injection (or within 24 hours
afterward). Tell your caregiver right away if you feel itchy, dizzy, weak,
light-headed, short of breath, or if you have a rash or hives, chest pain,
wheezing, sudden cough, or pounding heartbeats or fluttering in your chest.
