Singulair is a leukotriene (loo-koe-TRY-een) inhibitor. Leukotrienes are
chemicals your body releases when you breathe in an allergen (such as pollen).
These chemicals cause swelling in your lungs and tightening of the muscles
around your airways, which can result in asthma symptoms.

Singulair is used to prevent asthma attacks in adults and children as young as
12 months old. Singulair is also used to prevent exercise-induced
bronchoconstriction (narrowing of the air passages in the lungs) in adults and
children who are at least 6 years old.

Singulair is also used to treat symptoms of year-round (perennial) allergies
in adults and children who are at least 6 months old. It is also used to treat
symptoms of seasonal allergies in adults and children who are at least 2 years
old.

Singulair is used for allergies, only after other treatments have failed.

**If you already take Singulair to prevent asthma or allergy symptoms, do not
use an extra dose to treat exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.**





Get emergency medical help if you have **signs of an allergic reaction to
Singulair:** hives, blisters, severe itching; difficult breathing; swelling of
