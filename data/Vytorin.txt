Vytorin contains a combination of ezetimibe and simvastatin. Ezetimibe reduces
the amount of cholesterol absorbed by the body.

Simvastatin belongs to a group of drugs called HMG CoA reductase inhibitors,
or "statins."

Vytorin is used to lower blood levels of "bad" cholesterol (low-density
lipoprotein, or LDL) and triglycerides, to increase levels of "good"
cholesterol (high-density lipoprotein, or HDL), and to lower triglycerides (a
type of fat in the blood).

Vytorin is used together with a low-fat diet and other treatments to lower
total cholesterol in adults and children who are at least 10 years old. It is
not known whether this medicine reduces your risk of heart disease.
