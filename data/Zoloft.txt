Zoloft is an antidepressant that belongs to a group of drugs called selective

levels in the brain and nerves. Zoloft is used to treat some types of
depression, premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), social anxiety disorder
(SAD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder (PD), and post
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
