Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that affects the heart and circulation (blood
flow through arteries and veins).

Metoprolol is used to treat angina (chest pain) and hypertension (high blood
pressure).

Metoprolol is also used to lower your risk of death or needing to be
hospitalized for heart failure.

lower the risk of death.
