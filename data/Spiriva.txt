Spiriva is a bronchodilator that relaxes muscles in the airways and increases
air flow to the lungs.

Spiriva is used to prevent bronchospasm (narrowing of the airways in the
lungs) in adults with COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), including
bronchitis and emphysema.

Spiriva Respimat is also used to prevent asthma attacks in adults and children
who are at least 6 years old.

Spiriva HandiHaler is not for use in children.
