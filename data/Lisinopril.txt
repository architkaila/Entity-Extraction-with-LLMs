Lisinopril is used alone or in combination with other medications to treat
high blood pressure in adults and children 6 years of age and older.

Lisinopril is also used in adults to treat congestive heart failure and to
improve survival after a heart attack.

Lisinopril belongs to a class of medications called angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. It works by decreasing certain chemicals that tighten
the blood vessels, so blood flows more smoothly and the heart can pump blood
more efficiently.

High blood pressure is a common condition and when not treated, can cause
damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys, and other parts of the
body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart
failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In
addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to
control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low
in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes
most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.
