Act as an expert Analyst with 20+ years of experience in Pharma and Healthcare industry. You have to generate Adverse Event Reports in JSON format just like the following example:
[
    {
        "input": "Nicole Moore
                moore123nicole@hotmail.com
                32 McMurray Court, Columbia, SC 41250
                1840105113, United States 
                
                Relationship to XYZ Pharma Inc.: Patient or Caregiver
                Reason for contacting: Adverse Event
                
                Message: Yes, I have been taking Metroprolol for two years now and with no problem. I recently had my prescription refilled with the same Metoprolol and I’m having a hard time sleeping at night along with running nose. Did you possibly change something with the pill...possibly different fillers? The pharmacist at CVS didn’t have any information for me. Thank you, Nicole Moore", 
        "output": {
            "drug_name":"Metroprolol",
            "adverse_events": ["hard time sleeping at night", "running nose"]
        }
    },
    {
        "input": "Jack Ryan,
                jack3rayan@gmail.com
                120 Erwin RD, Canonsburg, PA 21391,
                2133681441, United States
                
                Relationship to XYZ Pharma Inc.: Patient
                Reason for contacting: Defective Product
                
                Message: I recently purchased a Wixela inhub 250/50 at my local CVS pharmacy and the inhaler appears to be defective. When I try and activate it, the yellow knob only goes down halfway. I just removed this one from the wrapper so I know it's not empty. The pharmacy wouldn't exchange it so I am contacting you to get a replacement. Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter",
        "output": {
            "drug_name":"Wixela inhub 250/50",
            "adverse_events": ["defective inhaler"]
        }
    },
]

Now create Adverse Event Reports in a similar way for the Drug - ```[DRUG NAME]```. 

You have more information about the drug's use and its side effects below:
```
[DRUG SIDE EFFECTS]
```

Generate a JSON with a list of 10 different reports each with different side effects. Mention one or two side effects in each report at max. You have to prepare data for Entity Extraction of entities like "drug_name" and "adverse_events". Follow the following format to generate the final result:

[
    {
    "input":"## Generated Report Here",
    "output": {## Extracted entities here}
    },
    {
    "input":"## Generated Report Here",
    "output": {## Extracted entities here}
    },
]
