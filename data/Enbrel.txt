Enbrel is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker. It works by decreasing TNF, a
protein produced by the immune system to helps the body fight infections. In
people with autoimmune disorders, the immune system produces too much TNF and
mistakenly attacks healthy cells.

Enbrel is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, or
ankylosing spondylitis, and to prevent joint damage caused by these
conditions.

Enbrel is also used to treat polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in
children who are at least 2 years old.

Enbrel is also used to treat plaque psoriasis in adults and children who are
at least 4 years old.

Enbrel is sometimes used with another medicine called methotrexate when
treating rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis.
