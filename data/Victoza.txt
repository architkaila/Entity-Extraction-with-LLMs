Victoza is similar to a hormone that occurs naturally in the body and helps
control blood sugar, insulin levels, and digestion.

Victoza is used together with diet and exercise to improve blood sugar control
in adults and children 10 years of age and older with type 2 diabetes
mellitus.

Victoza may also help reduce the risk of serious heart problems such as heart
attack or stroke in adults with type 2 diabetes and heart disease. It is
usually given after other diabetes medicines have been tried without success.
**Victoza is not for treating type 1 diabetes**.
